Interactive Resume
==================

Resume consist of six sections:

1. About - a short description about the author

2. Work Experience - a list of companies the author worked for. Each name
is a link to the given company's website

3. Skills - in a desktop version this is a chart showing the most prominent
of the author's skills. Chart is based on a project by Marcin Dziewulski 
(http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/04/22/animated-skills-diagram/). Files being 
part of this project are rafael.js, init.js, default.css, reset.css. In the 
mobile version of the page, chart is not displayed and a list of skills is 
displayed instead.

4. Education - a list of schools and online courses attended by the author. Each entry
links to a appropriate page.

5. Projects - a list of projects by the author
6. Map - an interactive map showing the author's places of work and education. Each pin
on the map can be clicked to open an info window, with a name of companies/school 
that the author worked at/attended in a given place. The name is a hyperlink that 
leads to an appropriate entry in Work Experience or Education.
